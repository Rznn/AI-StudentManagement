# Fuzzy Logic

The primary objectives of assessment and evaluation involve appraising students' academic achievements and enriching their educational experience. Various conventional methods are utilized to assess students' performance. Nevertheless, the traditional calculation system is fraught with several drawbacks. Several techniques can be explored, utilized, and integrated to create an effective system for analyzing student performance. As an example, fuzzy logic, a technique that mimics human-like cognitive processes in a control system. This methodology considers factors like student attendance, which is deemed pivotal in grading. The application of fuzzy logic empowers users to introduce subjectivity and ambiguity into values, if desired.
